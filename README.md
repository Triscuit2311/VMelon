# VMelon
A VRising tournament admin tool for participant observation.
This is a MelonLoader mod, and as such require that you install MelonLoader.

## Features
- FOV Changer
- Player and NPC information display

## Note
I should switch the entity query over to use the C# Jobs system, since it should run in a seperate thread. This could create a stutter every so often on lower-end machines, but I have no issues on an i9-10850k.
